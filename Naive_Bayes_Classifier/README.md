### Naive Bayes Classifier
The file present Naive Bayes Classifier written by me. 
The class was testes with data sets taken from website: [Machine Learning Depository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)
The algorithm is good for classification problem with categorital data. 

Exemplary results:
* Balloon data set  
Train set size 10, Test set size 10, Accuracy 0.8  
Train set size 13, Test set size 7, Accuracy 0.571428571429  
Train set size 15, Test set size 5, Accuracy 0.8  
  
* Balance data  
Train set size 312, Test set size 312, Accuracy 0.987179487179
